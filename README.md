# fourier_series
Here some python3.7 programs and explanations to understand Fourier series in another way !
/!\ Only use python 3.7 as many bugs occur on newer versions /!\

( The programs are a bit old so don't judge my old python skills, we all coded bad stuff when we started out. )


PS : Many thanks to Tamara for her help !
